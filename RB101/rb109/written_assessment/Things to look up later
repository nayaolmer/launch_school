Things to look up later

>> What it's called when you use the same variable name for two different variables in a code (Question 2 of practice test)

Question 3
### How does count treat the block's return value? How can we find out?
^^ I don't know what it means to "treat the block's return value"

The vocabulary for "scope"/things set outside of the scope of the loop?

What do they mean by return vs. output?



Good vocab:
(1) elements in an enumerable 
(2) Output
(3) Method invocation
(4) Method `do..end` block 
(5) evaluates to true/false, is truthy/falsy
