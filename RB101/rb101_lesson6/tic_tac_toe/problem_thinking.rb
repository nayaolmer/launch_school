#P - Understand the problem 

## How does tic tac toe work?
>> The game is played in a three-by-three grid
>> The goal of the game is to connect three of your pieces (either Xs or Os) either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally 
>> The two users take turns placing their pieces until either one player wins or all 9 squares of the board are filled

## Outline the sequence of the game:
(1) Display the board
(2) Allow the user to choose which square to place its piece
(3) Allow the computer to respond in kind and place its piece
(4) Display the updated board state
(5) If winner, display winner
(6) If tie, display tie,
(7) If neither winner nor tie, return to step 2
(8) If winner or tie, allow user to decide to play again or stop
(9) If play again, start at (1)
(10) If stop, display end message and quit program


continue until all the squares are filled or until the user or computer has acheived three in a row

Questions:
How does the computer decide where to place its piece? randomly or is there strategy?
