For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

(1) a method that returns the sum of two integers
(2) a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
(3) a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:


(1) a method that returns the sum of two integers
START

def METHOD (number_1, number_2)
  SET sum = number_1 + number_2
  return sum 
end

END

(2) a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

START 

GET array

def method(array_of_strings)
  concatenate all strings into single string 
end 

END

(3) a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. 

START

SET array_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def every_other_element(array)
  loop through array and select every other element, returning an array with just every other element 
end

END
